Project:

1. External Sources:
	- spacy: Downloaded using pip. Used documentation from spacy.io

2. I used a dynamic perceptron classifier, and the trained weights and biases have been saved into files. The time to process a single story should be very quick. You can uncomment the classifier portion of my code if you want to re-generate the weights and biases, and this *will* take a long time. 

3. I am working solo on this project (this was discussed with Professor Riloff)

4. There are no known problems or limitations of my system currently
